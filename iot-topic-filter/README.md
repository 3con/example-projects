# IOT Topic Filter Example

This is a trivial example that shows how to trigger Lambda functions when a message is posted to [AWS IOT Topics](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/topics.html). The lambda function just logs messages, so you can post a message to the topic and then check CloudWatch logs to see the execution result.

## Try it out

1. grab the dependencies: `npm install`
2. create the lambda function: `npm run create` 
3. set up a IOT topic filter: `npm run subscribe`
4. publish an event to the topic: `node post.js`
5. list cloudwatch logs associated with your function: `npm run check-logs`
